# Build Notes

This repository now contains a working gameplay prototype (`src/manicwilly_game.py`) with room data in `data/rooms.json`.

## Implemented

- Splash screen and persistent high scores.
- Collectible-based win condition.
- Multiple interconnected rooms with enemy patrols.
- Animated background and enemy sprites (procedural animation).

## Next upgrades

- Replace procedural visuals with generated sprite sheets.
- Expand room set to full JSW1+JSW2 equivalent maps.
- Add deterministic route simulation for full completion-time balancing.
- Add controller/touch UI overlays for Android-first play.
